# Adventures in Ledgers: Blockathon Ireland 2019

_Welcome to AiL's entry for the first Blockathon Ireland event, and happy hacking!_

## In this repo

You will find a set of demo pages. These illustrate how a planned use of a blockchain as a third party notary can add greater transparency and trustworthiness to data provided by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

## The tech in use

To present each page: [HTML5boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)

To mimic a CSO internal datastore: [Firebase cloud storage free tier](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/)

To notarise files: [OpenTimestamps client libraries](https://github.com/opentimestamps)
